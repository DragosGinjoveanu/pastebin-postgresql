# Pastebin
This is my first back-end project, created using Express.js.   
The application looks like a simplified version of the popular website "pastebin.com".   

The user can create a post, giving it a suitable title and description. All the posts can also be seen in a list and each post can be opened in a separate tab to be edited or deleted.   
##### Functionalities:
  -create new post  
  -see all the posts  
  -edit/delete for each post
##### Technologies:
  -Express.js  
  -Postgresql  
  -Bootstrap & Pug
